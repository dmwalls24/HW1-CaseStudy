Varo Money, Inc.

Varo Money is a neobank that was incorporated in November of 2015.The company was founded by Colin Walsh, Mykolya Klymenko, Assaf Guery, and Roger Van Duinen (Crunchbase, 2021).

 Colin Walsh, the current CEO and Co-Founder, was previously an Executive Vice President at American Express and has over 25 years of consumer banking experience. He has also worked at other well known financial institutions such as Wells Fargo and Visa (Walsh, 2021).

 Mykolya Klymenko or Kolya is a engineer executive that has roughly 30 years of technology experience. With a background in software development, Mr. Klymenko co-founded Varo before moving on to advise other fintech startups (Klymenko, 2021).

The idea for Varo Money came about from Mr. Walsh's idenfitication of a key underlying issue that plagues our world. The issue of systemic inequality, but within the arena of traditional banking. As the Varo website states, "Varo was founded to make a powerful impact on systemic financial inequality that Americans have experienced for generations." (Bank, 2021).

Varo Money has been funded by various investors in which it has received $482.4M in total funding. Of the fourteen investors, Varo's most recent investment was from Russell Westbrook Enterprises (RWE) for a total of $63M in February 2021(Crunchbase, 2021).

## Business Activities:

Varo Money serves as an alternative to traditional banking and the costs associated with having a traditional account. Varo is a neobank that primarily operates throuhg a mobile app that can be used by anyone. 

Varo's inteded customer is the everyday consumer looking for a cost free bank. Varo does not require a credit check to open an account nor does it have a minimum balance requirement for account holders. Account holders are also no subject to monthly fees or overdraft fees that would normally be found with a traditional bank account. 

The market size for this particular customer is wide open and will continue to grow. According to the Neobank Market report from Grand View Research, the market size value of Neobanks to date is 47.1B USD (Research, 2021).

Varo primarily operates through a mobile app. The application uses a cloud-native technology platform called Temenos Transact. According to Finextra, "Temenos' advanced cloud-native platform enables Varo to continuously deploy new features and products and rapidly innovate" (Finextra, 2020). Through the use of such platform, Varo is able to reduce its operating costs by automating backend processes while also meeting regulatory guidelines.

## Recommendations 
- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

If I were to advise this company, I would encourage them to focus heavily on providing credit and payment options for their customers. Since receiving its official charter papers from the OCC, Varo has the opportunity to grow large very fast. Varo should continue the push forward as if it were a traditional bank. 

By offering credit and payment options, Varo will provide the same services as its competitors at little to no cost. Varo will ultimately remain competitive. In order to provide these services, Varo should continue its investment  in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and API's. These technologies are appropriate because they are already in use and would not require any additional implementations.
